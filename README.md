# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
## Introduction:

Herein,  we wrote a Python code to explain the US bike share data by importing the data and then answering some
interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics. Also, we wrote a script to create an 
interactive experience by inserting raw input to present the calculated statistics.

The Datasets Source: Motivate
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for three cities (Chicago, New York City, and Washington) was used.
The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

Start Time
End Time
Trip Duration
Start Station
End Station
User Type

The Chicago and New York City files also have additional two columns:
Gender
Birth Year


### Softwares:

The following software was used to complete this project:
- Python
- Sublime text editor
- A terminal application
Questions:

### Asks the user to specify a city, month, and day to analyze. Then the following questions are answered

What is the most common month?

What is the most common day of the week?

What is the most common start hour?

What is the most commonly used start station?

What is the most commonly used end station?

What is the most frequent combination of start station and end station trips?

Display statistics on the total and average trip duration.

Displays statistics on bike-share users. Information about the user type, gender, the birth year.

What is the earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth?
